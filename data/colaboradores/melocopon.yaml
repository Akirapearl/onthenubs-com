name: "Melocop√≥n"
alias: "Miriam Domingo"
pronouns: "Ella"
bio: "During the early years of my proffesional carreer I stayed mostly on support-oriented and helpdesk possitions, thanks to which I have developed a proper troubleshooting capacity, this also came alongside an effective mindset for documentation and mentoring based on the knowledge I did obtain. At the moment I'm going through a learning path as devops, which allows me to get a more comprehensive mindset about these new technologies I'm currently using. (I.e Jenkins, Rancher as GUI for Kubernetes management)."
